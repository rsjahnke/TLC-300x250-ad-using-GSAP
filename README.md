# TLC-300x250-ad-using-GSAP
Sample 300x250 ad created as a Digital Production intern with Discovery's in-house creative agency for TLC show Counting On. All images in the ad are pulled from one sprite sheet, which I compiled into one PNG after pulling the individual components from the PhotoShop file delivered from our designers. I then animated the individual components using TweenMax from the GSAP JavaScript library.
