# TLC-300x250-ad-using-GSAP
Sample 300x250 ad created for TLC show Counting On while I worked as Digital Production intern to Discovery's in-house creative agency. All images in the ad are pulled into the html from one sprite sheet, which I compiled using the individual PhotoShop components delivered by our designers. I used TinyPNG to compress the sprite sheet to an optimal file size - as tiny/lightweight as possible, without losing quality. I then animated the individual components using TweenMax from the GSAP JavaScript library.
